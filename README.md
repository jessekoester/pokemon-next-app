## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

# or

# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result of the page that calls the PokeAPI.

Open [http://localhost:3000/api/pokemon/details/charizard](http://localhost:3000/api/pokemon/details/charizard) to see the response from the API. 
replace charizard with pikachu to get a new response from the PokeAPI. Additional if no name is found when an invalid name is searched on the API will reply with a not found.
